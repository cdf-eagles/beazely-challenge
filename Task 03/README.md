# Task 3

## You have a nested object, create a function that allows for the nested object and a key and returns the value of key. Any language besides Elixir is acceptable.

### Proposed Solution:
Python script

## NFRâ€™s: There must be Error Handling and unit testing in this challenge.

### Proposed Solution:
Python script to recursively search the object for the provided key

## Solution implemented
While I was able to create a function to recursively search the object for a specific key, I was not able to figure out how to search for a nested key as well (key "a/b/c" resulting in "d").

I was also not able to think of how to unittest this script.

See [task3.script](task3.script) for testing output.
